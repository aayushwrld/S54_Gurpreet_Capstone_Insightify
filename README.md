# Insightify

## Idea Brief

The capstone project entails the development of a sophisticated web-based survey platform, merging user-friendly functionality with cutting-edge AI features. This platform empowers users to effortlessly create and distribute surveys, while also offering advanced capabilities such as real-time response tracking, percentage calculation, and dynamic data visualization. Notably, the inclusion of AI algorithms enables automatic summarization of open-ended text responses, providing users with valuable insights and actionable conclusions. With a robust technology stack and a focus on user experience, this project aims to deliver a comprehensive solution for efficient survey management and insightful data analysis.

## Key Features

- *User Authentication:* Users will be required to sign up and log in to access the platform. User authentication ensures security and personalized access to features.
- *Survey Creation:* Registered users can create customized surveys with various question types such as multiple-choice, rating scales, and open-ended text boxes.
- *Survey Distribution:* Upon creating a survey, the system will generate a unique link that users can share with their target audience to collect responses.
- *Response Tracking:* Users can monitor responses in real-time, viewing metrics such as response rates and completion times.
- *AI Summarization:* For open-ended text responses, an AI algorithm will analyze and summarize the data, providing users with key insights and trends from the feedback received.
- *Response Analytics:* The platform will offer visualizations and analytics tools to help users interpret survey results effectively. This includes graphs, charts, and statistical summaries.
- *Percentage Calculation:* Users will receive a percentage breakdown of responses for each question, facilitating easy interpretation of data.
